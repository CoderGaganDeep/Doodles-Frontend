          Doodles is a private Pre School serving children between the age group
          of 2.4 to 6 years. The management of Doodles feels that children need
          the benefits of having individual attention, as the first formative
          years are very crucial and also difficult from the perspective of the
          child.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="lato">
          The environment at Doodles has been designed to allow children to move
          around freely and it also provides a spacious work and play area.
          Cleanliness and Hygiene play a very important role in the Doodles
          Environment. With regard to the adults/teachers at PreSchool /
          Afternoon care, we have a 1:8 ratio, means each teacher has upto 8
          children to observe and present.

                    The Pre School has a well structured , age appropriate
                    curriculum for the early years .Doodles Preschool takes
                    children only after they turn 2.4 years, as we are of the
                    firm belief that a child less than this age does need the
                    security of their immediate family and it is after 2.4 years
                    that they will be more open to take on the third environment
                    i.e., the Preschool. Preschool maintains a ratio of children
                    to adult as 8:1
